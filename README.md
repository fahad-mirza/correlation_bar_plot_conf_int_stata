# Correlation Plot with Confidence Intervals (Error Bars) & P-Values | Stata

Created a version of the Correlation Matrix in a Diverging Bar Plot form using Stata. This version includes an addition of 95% confidence interval (error bars) with the coefficient.

Once the dofile executes, you will be presented with a dataset that contains information on the lower and upper bound of each estimate, P-Value, Stars, Y and X axis values if you want to create a visual of the matrix itself rather than just making bar plots.
